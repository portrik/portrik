# Hello there!

Hi, I am Patrik. Yes, it is spelled without 'c'. Yes, it is pronounced the same as the one with 'c'. And no, you probably will not be able to pronounce my last name. I cannot do it most of the time myself.

## The Stuff I Do

I like to do stuff. The more stuff I do, the happier I am. It is even better if the stuff is software. 

**My Favorite Stuff:**

* VS Code
* JavaScript
* Python
* Games 
* Testing (Automated, of course)
