# Hello there!

Hi, I am Patrik. Yes, it is spelled without 'c'. Yes, it is pronounced the same as the one with 'c'. And no, you probably will not be able to pronounce my last name. I cannot do it most of the time myself.

I am currently working as a Junior QA Engineer. I am mostly involved with creation of tools supporting the QA process but I have experience with writing automated tests in TypeScript, Python, Dart and others. I have experience with manual testing, nevertheless, I try to automate everything. It's a better developer experience. And it helps with CI/CD.

My currently preferred language is TypeScript but I am down to clown with about everything. As long as it does not involve PHP or Java.
