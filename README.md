# Hello There üëã

I am Patrik. I like to do higher level programming, analog photography and video games.

## Tech Stack üíª

* üíª MacBook Pro 16" Intel
  * Would love to switch to 14"
  * Except for the notch because why would I need that
* macOS
  * It really just works (most of the time)
  * But I am partial to Linux as well
  * Or any other UNIX-like system
  * As long as it is not Windows (games are an exception)
* VS Code
  * Light
  * Open source
  * Extensible
  * Literally could not be cheaper

## Languages üë®‚Äçüíª

There may be a lot of languages in my repositories. I do not use a lot of them now due to them being either a school assignments or failed experiments. However, I still have a soft spot for C++ in my heart as my first language. Even though it is a piece of üí© for making safe software without years of experience.

* TypeScript
  * Because types make sense
  * Because JavaScript does not
  * Frontend or backend, it does not really matter
  * Also people pay me to work with it
* Python
  * Because it is everywhere
  * It is a nice change of pace compared to the rest
  * People also pay me to work with it
* Dart
  * It actually is a lovely language
  * With that said, I hate Flutter. Boilerplate and all
  * Would love to work with it more
* Other higher level languages
  * I don't like thinking about pointers or garbage collection
  * I would put Swift, V and Go here
* Actually, I am down to work with anything
  * As long as the pay is proportionate to my irritation
  * And I do not have to deal with MS Teams
