# Hello There

My name is Patrik Dvořáček. I like to do cool stuff with computers. The more strictly typed, explicitly coded, and well-defined these things are, the better. I am a big fan of [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/), and [TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com/), for example. Especially the [TigerStyle code guide](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/2830f94b0b3bf9f8ca3a7ab0af35e255d214c11a/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md) that I try to follow in higher-level languages.

And I do not like working with LLM-generated content. **Yuck**.
